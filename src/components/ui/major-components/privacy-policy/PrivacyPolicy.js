We collect this information for the sole purpose of responding to such inquiries and do not store the contact information unless requested to do so, as in the case of job applicants who submit resumes.</p>

                                        <strong>How and Why We Gather Information</strong>
                                    </h6>
                                    <p>When you register for an account for the Services or at any later time, we collect certain personal information from you to open an account, transact business, communicate with you, verify your identity and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. We call this your “Profile.” From time to time, we may request additional information (e.g., through surveys) to help us further assess your needs and preferences.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving Busnet the permission to use and store it consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may also obtain your personal information from your transactions with us or other Users through the Services, or from third parties such as credit reporting agencies. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that you provide directly to us through or in connection with the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <strong>Cookies</strong>
                                    </h6>
                                    <p>When you visit the Website, whether or not you register for an account, we may send one or more cookies.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <ul className="privacy-policy-list">
                                        <li>“Cookies” are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that may be placed on your web browser. Cookies make it easier for you to navigate our Website by, among other things, “remembering” your identity so that you do not have to input your password multiple times as you navigate between web pages on the Website and/or as you access the Services. This use of cookies for authentication (i.e., verifying that you are who you say you are) is an essential component of site security. You can set your web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set.&nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>A “web beacon” is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site or in an email which allows the website to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon.&nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>“Server logs” can be either a single log file or several log files automatically created and maintained by a server of activity performed by the server, which can include information about any transaction you conduct with the server.&nbsp;</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Please note that if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality or slower site response times. Declining to use our authentication-related cookies may prevent you from using the Website altogether.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>We or our service providers may also collect web surfing data related to your use of the Services (e.g., information regarding which of our web pages you access, the frequency of such access, and your product and service preferences). This may be accomplished by using cookies, web beacons, page tags or similar tools. Such web surfing data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, click stream data, operating system and the dates and times that you visit the Website. Web surfing data and similar information may be used for administrative purposes; to assess the usage, value and performance of our online products and services; and to improve your experience with the Services.</p>

                                    <p>You can log in to the Website using social media services such as Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Our Website may also include social sharing features for common social networks. These features are interactive mini-programs and may collect your IP address and the page you are visiting on our site. They may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>

                                    </h6>
                                    <p>Busnet will send you email notifications from time to time. Some notifications are required elements of your transactions on our platform, such as confirmations of particular actions you have taken. These mandatory notices are sent typically to notify you of a change in status. For example, you will receive a notice when your account is confirmed.</p>
                                    <p>We also send out notices that are required for legal or security purposes. For example, certain notifications are sent for your own protection to ensure that another person cannot make a change to your account without your knowledge. In other cases, these notifications involve changes to various legal agreements or Site policies. Generally, you may not opt out of such service-related emails.</p>
                                    <p>When you register an account, you will receive emails that confirm specific actions you requested. These will include emails to which you must respond to complete your registration and notifications confirming your registration. When you register an account and opt-in to Busnet’s SMS Communications program, you are consenting to receive text messages sent by an automatic telephone dialing system and acknowledge that data usage charges may apply by your cell phone company. You may receive text messages regarding system notifications, updates, and special offers and promotions, and can manage your opt-in status in your user profile.</p>
                                    <p>We may also send you responses to emails you send us, if appropriate. From time to time, we will also send user surveys, requests for user feedback regarding user experience and Site operations, or marketing offers from us or from us on behalf of our marketing partners. Completing these surveys, answering requests for feedback, or accepting any offer is strictly voluntary.</p>
                                    <p>Busnet will never send you an email asking you for your login information. In general, you can protect yourself against phishing by never providing personal or login information via a link contained in an email; instead, go the website directly. You might also make it a habit to check the URL of a website to be sure that it begins with the correct domain. In the case of Busnet, you should always ensure the URL begins with <a href="https://busnet.org">https://busnet.org</a>.</p>
